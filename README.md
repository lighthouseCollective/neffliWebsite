### Structure of the Site
The site revolves around a linked ***NavBar*** that follows the user down the page. After one initial load, all website content is available throughout the vertical page which prevents undesirable loading time. While the site is vertically dense, it is visually stimulating to counteract the short attention spans of modern consumers.

At any time, the viewer can return to the top of the page by clicking the ***take a look around*** button on the top left of the screen. Because the ***NavBar*** follows the user, it is very easy and quick to navigate to the varying sections of the site.
