### Building the Site

The Neffli website is built using an automated Makefile script.  On Linux/UNIX, use the following terminal commands:

```bash
[user@computer ]$ git clone https://github.com/lighthouseCollective/neffliWebsite.git
[user@computer ]$ cd neffliWebsite
[user@computer neffliWebsite]$ make build
```

After executing the aforementioned sequence of commands, the website will be built and deposited into `./_build`
where `.` is the directory the user issued the `make build` command from.
